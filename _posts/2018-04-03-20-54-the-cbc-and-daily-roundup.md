> I also need to be a little bit more careful about what I say on this blog. Apparently, the LAPD and Captain Hammer are among our viewers.

Yesterday, I said I would get to the maintainer audits today. I wasn't able to orchestrate a deep work session. Instead, I bounced between the following tasks:

- Went on the CBC - Radio Canada. I talked about the [Silent Book Club](http://silentbookclub.com/) I'm hosting on Thursday at a local bookstore here, the first time the event has been hosted in this city. The listernship was something in the tens, if not hundreds of thousands, and at least one friend emailed me to say he heard me talk at 6:10am in the morning.
- Visited the Montr√©al Basilica for the first time, and meditated in the giant Catholic church.
- Dredged up [old press releases](https://github.com/RichardLitt/richardlitt.github.com/blob/master/_data/press.yml#L59-L80) and added the CBC logo to [burntfen.com](https://burntfen.com).
- Triaged all of my Maintainer tickets.
- Visited my girlfriend in the clinic for emotional support, especially as it was my car door that accidentally broke her finger.
- Watched half of Randy Pausch's video on time management. His grid proved useful.
- Bought a bike pump converter.
- Had a power nap, as I woke up at 4:30am.
- Booked a car from April 17th to April 27th to Pittsburgh. That means I am definitively driving to [Heartifacts](https://codeandsupply.co/heartifacts), and that I am going to be hitting up Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Burlington, Boston, and the high points of five states on the way. You're all invited.
- Booked a plane to Dublin from May 14th to July 13th, for the summer. I'm also likely going to the Node Collaboration Summit in Berlin at the end of May and JSConf in early June.
- Finished the paperwork for my taxes and accounting for 2017, and talked to my accountant;
- Bought new fastpacking shoes from [inov-8](https://www.inov-8.com/us/catalog/product/view/id/4988/s/roclite-320-gtx-mens-trail-running-shoes-orange/category/38/) after my X-Talon 212s were too narrow, even when I ordered a size up.
- Researched and worked on physio for my ankle dorsalflexion and for my metatarsal stress fracture rehab. Wrote my PT with some open questions.
- Answered all of my outstanding altMBA letters from alumni.

### Post mortem

I was too tired to functionally make myself stop and focus today, which shows a lack of discipline and order that I am unhappy with. I was also too tired to realise that I skipped lunch, so I'm amazed I got anything done at all. All that having been said, for a day in which I effectively didn't manage to get deep, focused research done, I did manage a wide variety of tasks that will make the rest of my life easier. I now know where I will be until July 13th; I have my route planned through Scotland, and am committed to my trans-Scotland walk; I'm also committed to Pittsburgh and a single route; and I've also done something that makes me, an American in Canada, proud - I've contributed usefully to global Canadian culture, in a way that made my barista roll his eyes and say: "How f*cking millenial".

I should have taken a second nap. I should have done the tax work, earlier in the day. And I should have emailed my PT two days ago, instead of festering over the work.

I made no money today. I spent:

- $150 on shoes;
- $480 on flights;
- $300 on a car;
- $10 on coffee;
- $1 on a pump converter

Room to grow.
