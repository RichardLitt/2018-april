One of the issues with intending to do a streak of posting is that if you miss one day, you're far more likely to miss the next day. Also, it enforces poor behaviour; you're more likely to push out posts which are suboptimal because you feel you need to post something on a certain day, than because you actually think a post is worth posting.

I've fallen prey to both of these already in the past few days. Not a very long run. Let's get back to posting here.
