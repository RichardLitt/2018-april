I realise that I haven't been clear how this blog is useful to me. Here's the short version: this blog helps me distill my thoughts by forcing me to write them out for an external audience, in a sort of rubber-ducking. It also helps me point those thoughts at others, so I can ask questions or get feedback. Finally, it's helpful as a reminder that I'm not working alone; I have friends and 'followers' (whatever that actually means) who are interested in what I'm doing, and whom I may be able to help and who may be able to help me in approaching our goals. Making in public is better, for this reason, than making in private. It enables community, even if community in this case consists of writing posts like this.

There are downsides. It takes time, for one. For two, it's public - I'm not exactly holding back a ton, here (unless you want to know about stress fracture recovery and the plumber fixing my sink this morning). For three, it's low signal. A lot of these posts are wandering, scattered, and I write more than most people would like to read. I don't have an answer to that. I know this helps me, so I plan to keep going.

Comments and thoughts appreciated. My main venues I watch are [@richlitt](https://twitter.com/richlitt) and [richard@burntfen.com](mailto:richard@burntfen.com).
