Note: This post is part of my 'Learning to say no' process. [Read how this started here](https://richardlitt.github.io/2018-april/2018/04/13/12-46-learning-to-say-no/).

I am going through my list of projects (which I keep in a folder, mostly as Markdown files) and removing and closing as many projects as I can. By definition, this is a largely personal exercise, but you may get some small use from reading these.

### The Carbon Neutral Nomad

Keeping this one and actively working on it, specifically with a friend.

### Carbon Zerow

In January of this year, four of my friends rowed across the ocean. I've set up a website for them at [carbonzerow.org](https://carbonzerow.org/), and I ran their social media while they were rowing. As far as I know, I have one more task to do for this - to make a final printout of their speech they gave to family and friends. It should take an hour or two to clean up. Then this will be done.

I've taken five minutes now and added this project to my website, from which I realised it was lacking. You can see it [here](https://www.burntfen.com/projects/carbon-zerow/).

### High Point all of the 50 states

It is my goal to hit all of the high points of all 50 states. This is an exceptionally lazy goal, but I do manage to rack up a few every year. As there is no expressed need for this to be sped up, and nothing to do but wait until my Pittsburgh trip next week where I hope to summit five more states, I am just going to put this on hold for the rest of the summer. That means taking the placeholder out of my todo list.

### Code Poetry

I will not start or work on a website for code poetry this summer. Goodbye.

### Dean's Sun's Site

I need to make a website for my friend Dean's son, Sun. This was part of $2117, which was successful in that I reached my goal, but less successful in that I didn't do all of the work when I actually ran the project. So, this will have to get done in the next few weeks. Luckily, this is clearly scoped; when it is done, it's done.

### Essays over coffee

I won't start a blog about essays over coffee this summer. Perhaps next. No.

### Ethereum.js

I won't get involved with Ethereum.js this summer. Perhaps in the fall. No.

### Ethereum

I won't set up an Ethereum wallet, either. No.

### Friends

I keep a list of friends to contact periodically. I'm going to keep this as a priority.

### Francis Bacon and Eggs

I unfortunately won't get to do any of these this summer. I may do an _ad hoc_ episode, but I won't be actively planning on doing any at the moment. It's not a huge priority for me, although it is fun.

I eagerly look forward to returning to this when I have a new place to live in September. (Sorry, Fred.)

### Get over my fear of sailing

I won't be sailing this summer, unless I randomly make a trip to Sicily that I don't currently have planned. Moving this to the fall.

### Get paid to write a book

This may happen, but I'm not going to priotize making it work this summer. No.

### Get published in the new yorker

Not this summer, either. No.

### Get rid of all of my debt

Not this summer, either. But I should plan on getting rid of at least two loans, so this would be a good thing to have open. Keeping this as an active project.

### GitHub Portfolio Site

This one is tricky. I could make some money from it; I could make it a business; I could help others; and I could probably make a splash. But I'm not sure I have the time to develop it and ship it, and once I do ship, I don't know if I'd have the energy to keep it going. I'd have to offload the majority of the work. But that's not a reason not to do it.

Right now, a friend of mine is going through a process that would benefit from this site. So, it might be worth actually speccing this out now. I'll ask him if he'd be interested in doing it with me. If not, I am going to shelve this until the fall.

### Grants

While cool, I don't really have a reason to apply for an [Awesome Foundation Grant](http://www.awesomefoundation.org/) at the moment. However, I should look into getting some adventure grants for my trip. Let's add that to the list of things to do for the 500 mile trip, and remove project as something I'm thinking about.

That's enough for today.
