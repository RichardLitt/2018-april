### Burnt Fen Overhaul

I posted the last link on Twitter, and I got some feedback from my old friend Jana. I've gone through and edited the pages to have a bit better styling, in particular adding a button to project pages. This little touch will add a lot - I'm glad she pointed it out.

### Buy New Hoodie

This is on my list of items because mine, an old cotton hoodie from Uniqlo, has officially died. And while it is tempting to say that this takes no time and shouldn't be there, there's something I want to do: research what hoodies are good for hiking, what hoodies are sustainable, and what it would cost to find a combination of the two.

Looking online, there are sustainable hoodies, but I would have to pay shipping anyway. I think it makes more sense to stop looking for a sustainable hoodie altogether, and perhaps buy a cheap cotton one next week when I am in Philadelphia, for all of my city-non-backpacking needs.

On the other hand - if I am ultralighting, bringing along my current wool sweater is a horrible move. It wears 496g, and takes up more space than my tent, and will take up even more space and weight if it gets wet (although it will keep me warm). A 250 Merino hoodie from REI [costs $115](https://www.rei.com/rei-garage/product/134590/smartwool-merino-250-sport-pattern-hoodie-mens), and would do me far better than spending another $40 at Uniqlo for a cotton hoodie I can't bring with me, and should be a workable substitute for a massive all-wool sweater. Looking now, Smartwool, Icebreaker, and Ibex (the main designers I looked at) all have competitive features, but they range higher. [This one looks good](https://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Icebreaker-Men-s-Ellipse-LS-Half-Zip-Hood_10303090_10208_10000001_-1_), but the price is prohibitive.

I am going to keep my Â£20 wool sweater I got at a charity shop, and if it gets too heavy, I'll think about getting a new one. For now, the price of cutting down weight is too high, and with summer around the bend, anyway, I'll just have to go hoodieless for a while. That's OK; hats and jackets remove the need for a hoodie, in any event. It's just wasted fabric.

I'm going to decide not to spend any more time on this, and moving it to `waiting`, as there's nothing for me to do but to see if I like a hoodie when I see one.

### More overhaul

Unfortunately, I got dragged into another issue on https://burntfen.com. I should have prepared for this. Now, however, you can click through to other projects [from within a project page](https://www.burntfen.com/projects/maintainer-mountaineer/). This will dramatically improve site flow, I believe, as users will bounce around more instead of just clicking on a few projects. I also fixed up some assets and removed a lot of poor css. Ok. On to the next thing.
