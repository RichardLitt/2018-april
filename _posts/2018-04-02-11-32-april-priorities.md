April. A new month. My goal last month had been to write my thesis; I wasn't able to complete this in time. I still have time, but it does push back my plans a bit. This month, I am hoping to do better.

Focusing on multiple priorities hasn't proved to be a useful exercise. At some level, I'll never be able to focus entirely - I still have to eat, sleep, exercise. However, mentally, I ought to be able to focus on one thing at a time, by time boxing certain activities and with adequate planning.

The first priority are my clients, mostly freelance, and my paying customers through Maintainer. The second priority are my Patreons, who expect something from their donation. The third priority is my thesis, which I'm going to focus on weekend evenings until all of my client jobs are done, at which point it'll go back to being first priority for a while. Last month, I tried to focus on the thesis first - and I didn't get very far in terms of client work, or making money. Let's fix that this month.

My money situation isn't great. I've spent roughly $3000 a month to live over the past few months. I want to make sure that I'm able to make that much money, after taxes, this month. I also want to pay off my two remaining Federal loans; as of right now, that's $8,808.33. These have a lower interest than my other larger loans, but I pay proportionally more for these as the minimum is higher, and I want to use the [snowball method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-snowball_method) to pay off my loans, because I think that has better psychological feedback than hitting the larger loans first. That means I need to make roughly $18,000 before taxes this month, or set up contracts where it's possible to do that in the future. This is an outlandish goal, but I don't think it's impossible if I focus on providing value (as opposed to just getting money, which can more easily lead to shoddy work). It's a moonshot; I just happen to be predisposed to moonshot goals.

Finally, I've got some travel planned this April. I'm driving to Pittsburgh on the 16th, and may not return to Montréal immediately afterwards. So, I need to also plan for both that trip and for any other trips happening in May and June, and to move my stuff out of Montréal by then.

My goals for this month, in bullet points:

- Close all open client jobs.
- Earn $18,000.
- Finish my MSc thesis.
- Wrap up my time in Montréal.
- Blog on this website at least once a day, without fail.
- Weekly newsletters and patreon posts, without fail.
- Drive to Pittsburgh; highpoint New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.

Let's get started.
