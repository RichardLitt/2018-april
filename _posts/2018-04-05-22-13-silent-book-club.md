After a work day (largely rote tasks, but also another Maintainer review, and some interviews), I rested by going to my second meetup I hosted this week. The first, last night, was the Decentralized Web Meetup here in Montr√©al, where we talked about open source and ways of funding it. I ended up talking more than I expected, which often unfortunately happens.

Tonight, the opposite occurred - because it was the Silent Book Club. At Drawn and Quarterly, a graphic novel publishing house and bookstore, around nine people came from seven to nine on a weeknight, sat down, didn't say much to each other (in three cases, nothing at all), and then read books for two hours. I read some of William Morris's early fantasy short stories, and _Deep Work_ by Carl Newport.

It was absolute bliss.
