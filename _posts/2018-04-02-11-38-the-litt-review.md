This morning, I had a few goals. The first was to finish my reviews for Gracestone Publishing, a publishing house that reached out to me to review two of their books. The founder used to be my old youth group leader. I reviewed one of the books - the young adult fantasy - this morning, and have sent off the review. I just got off a call with them, as I'm not going to be able to read the second book - it's a retelling of the Biblical story, and I don't think I could give an impartial opinion on it as an athiest, and I don't think I would have enjoyed reading it.

This was the first paid review that came out of me opening up my book reviews on [The Litt Review](https://burntfen.com/the-litt-review). While I am focused on that work, I want to close up [some issues](https://github.com/RichardLitt/richardlitt.github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) on the site. That done, I should be able to put the Litt Review out of my head for a while, until I read another book, at least. Let's clean up some other issues on burntfen.com while I am at it.

So, here are my current open issues:
