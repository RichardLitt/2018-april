One of the projects I gave up when I archived and deleted the vast majority of my projects was this one. I didn't mean for that to happen, but it did, and I'm not sorry for not updating you in a while.

I've been working on my thesis. As a result of having one thing I am doing every day, I've written more in the past two weeks than in the past four years. I've been deprioritizing my business, coding, writing, and anything else that gets in the way. Instead, I've been working for hours every day, learning, writing, and contributing meaningfully to something which has been bugging me for half a decade.

I've also been, almost uniformly, happier. I'm utterly shocked by how easy happiness in work is to achieve, on how focused you can be, if you drop everything else and work on a single project. I'm going to keep going.

Send me an email. I'll read it when I'm ready.
